<p>In this book we&rsquo;ll be building a web application called Snippetbox, which lets people paste and share snippets of text &mdash; a bit like <a href="https://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a> or GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>. Towards the end of the build it will look a bit like this:</p>

<figure class="img">
<img src="assets/img/01.00-01.png" alt="01.00-01.png" />
</figure>

<p>Our application will start off super simple, with just one web page. Then with each chapter we&rsquo;ll build it up step-by-step until a user is able save and view snippets via the app. This will take us through topics like how to structure a project, routing requests, working with a database, processing forms and displaying dynamic data safely.</p>

<p>Then later in the book we&rsquo;ll add user accounts, and restrict the application so that only registered users can create snippets. This will take us through more advanced topics like configuring a HTTPS server, session management, user authentication and middleware.</p>

<h3 id="conventions">Conventions</h3>

<p>Throughout this book code blocks are shown with a silver background like below. If the code is particularly long, parts that aren&rsquo;t relevant may be replaced with an ellipsis. To make it easy to follow along, most code blocks also have a title bar at the top indicating the name of the file that we&rsquo;re working on.</p>

<figure class="code go">
<figcaption>File: hello.go</figcaption>
<pre><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">main</span>

<span class="o">...</span> <span class="c1">// Indicates that some existing code has been omitted.
</span><span class="c1"></span>
<span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">sayHello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;Hello world!&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></pre>
</figure>

<p>Terminal (command line) instructions are shown with a black background and start with a dollar symbol. These commands should work on any Unix-based operating system, including Mac OSX and Linux. Sample output is shown in silver beneath the command, like so:</p>

<figure class="code bash">
<pre>$ echo &#34;Hello world!&#34;
<samp>Hello world!</samp></pre>
</figure>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Windows, you should replace the command with the DOS equivalent or carry out the action via the normal Windows GUI.</p>

<p>Some chapters in this book end with an <em>additional information</em> section. These sections contain information that isn&rsquo;t relevant to our application build, but is still important (or sometimes, just interesting) to know about. If you&rsquo;re very new to Go, you might want to skip these parts and circle back to them later.</p>

<aside class="hint"><p>
<strong>Hint:</strong> If you&rsquo;re following along with the application build I recommend using the HTML version of this book instead of the PDF or EPUB. The HTML version works in all browsers, and the proper formatting of code blocks is retained if you want to copy-and-paste code directly from the book.
